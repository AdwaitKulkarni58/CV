  <h2>Computer Science and Mathematics Courses completed</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em><a href="http://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/syllabus.html", alt="CPSC 110">CPSC 110:</a></em></strong> This course is an introduction to programming concepts using the Racket programming language and assumes no prior knowledge of programming. It taught me how to design and develop complicated programs in a systematic manner by breaking down big ideas into small steps.</li><br>
  <li><strong><em><a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=121", alt="CPSC 121">CPSC 121: </a></em></strong> This course teaches Boolean algebra by using truth tables, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, proof techniques, sets, finite state machines, and regular expressions. It taught me how to think in a logical and analytical manner and also made me aware of how computer instructions are executed.</li><br>
  <li><strong><em><a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule;jsessionid=JsuF2SDe54fiDWoVc2bEtQW5?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=100", alt="MATH 100">MATH 100: </a></em></strong>This course teaches Calculus 1 (derivatives and their applications). I learnt what derivatives are, how they are calculated, how they can be applied to real world situations. I also learnt their graphical representations and how derivative functions can be optimized.</li><br>
  <li><strong><em><a href="https://www.courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=101", alt="MATH 101">MATH 101: </a></em></strong>This course teaches Calculus 2 (antiderivatives and their applications). I learnt what antiderivatives are and how they are calculated. I also learnt different integration techniques and their application in diverse problem scenarios. Lastly, this course taught me what Taylor series for different infinite series look like.</li>
